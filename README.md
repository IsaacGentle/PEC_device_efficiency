# PEC_device_efficiency #

This is a MATLAB script to implement a non-linear circuit analysis of any configuration photo-electrochemical (PEC) electrolysis in order to determine the maximum theorectical solar-to-fuel efficiency. Enjoy!

A paper has been submitted detailing the uses and the inner workings of the code. In the meantime, please see the GitHub wiki pages for a user manual.

## Installation ##

You have two options:

1) Clone or download a copy of the git folder here and run the code direct in MATLAB. Run the following command to get the GUI to load.
```
GUI_init()
```
2) If you don't have access to MATLAB, I have compiled the graphical user interface into a release (see release tab). The installer will need access to the internet to install the required (and free) MATLAB runtime.
